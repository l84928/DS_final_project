In this work, we use multiple models for rumor detection on twitter, among which BertGCN performs best. BertGCN is a text classification model that combines large-scale pretraining and transduction learning. BertGCN constructs heterogeneous graphs on datasets and represents documents as nodes using BERT representations. By jointly training the BERT and GCN modules in BertGCN. Experiments show that BertGCN has the best performance compared to other NN models.
